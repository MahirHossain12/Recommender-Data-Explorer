## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a two-part journey through **data exploration** and **recommendation system development**, focused on a real-world Udemy course dataset. It aims to:

* Analyze trends in course categories, prices, ratings, and enrollments
* Build a **personalized recommendation engine** to suggest relevant courses based on user preferences

Perfect for learners, data enthusiasts, and edtech developers looking to blend **data analytics** with **practical machine learning**.

## 📂 What's Inside

### 📘 1. EDA\_on\_UdemyDataset.ipynb

Gain a data-driven understanding of Udemy's course landscape with:

* **Top instructors**, course categories & subcategories
* Rating distributions & popularity scores
* Free vs paid course comparison
* Heatmaps, boxplots, bar plots, and interactive charts
* Insights on pricing, publishing trends, and review patterns

### 🤖 2. Course\_Recommendation\_System.ipynb

A recommendation system built using:

* **Text vectorization** (`TF-IDF`) on course titles/descriptions
* **Cosine similarity** to find semantically similar courses
* **Content-based filtering** – recommend by input keywords/title
* Easily extendable to user profiling or collaborative filtering

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data wrangling
* `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` – Data visualization
* `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning & similarity metrics
* `NLTK` or `spaCy` – Text cleaning & tokenization
